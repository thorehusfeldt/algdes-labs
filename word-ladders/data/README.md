## Testing

For size n, the file

	words-<n>-in.txt

contains a number of test cases that you can try, one per line.
For instance, here is words-10-in.txt:

	other there
	other their
	could would
	would could
	there other
	about there

The corresponding out-file contains, for each line, the number of edges no the shortest path from the first word to the last.
Otherwise, it contains “-1”.
For instance, words-10-out.txt:

	1
	1
	1
	1
	-1
	-1 

tells you that there is a shortest path of lenght 1 from “other” to “their”.
There is no path at all from “there” to “other”.

To run through all test cases, you can edit the file scriptExample.sh by changing the execution command.
